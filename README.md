Construct a table that includes all the data from all three sections. This table would better have the 18 agents (10 antibiotics, 7 disinfectants and the blanks as control group) that we tested as separate columns.
For each group in each section you can add a row with the responding measurements. You can better add an additional column with an information on the name of the organism. 

In the end youâ€™ll have 9 E. coli and 9 S. aureus data for each agent. For one of the microorganisms, compare effectiveness of each agent to the control by applying an appropriate statistical test (justify your test of choice). 

Discard the non-significant agents. This means your microorganism has developed resistance to those. 

T.test Then, compare significant antibiotics among each other with an appropriate test and rank them according to their effectiveness (justify your test of choice). Do the same for disinfectants. Anova Repeat the b and c for the other microorganism. 

Check if data produced by your bench is consistent with these results. For each agent compare measurements of E. coli vs. S. aureus with an appropriate test (justify your test of choice). 
Check if data produced by your bench is consistent with these results.
